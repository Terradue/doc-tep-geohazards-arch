Purpose of the software
-----------------------

The ESA e-Collaboration for Earth Observation project addresses the technologies and architectures needed to
provide a collaborative research Platform for automating data mining and information extraction experiments. 

The E-CEO Data Challenges platform serves for the implementation of open challenges focusing on Information Extraction for
EO applications. 

The possibility to implement – through the challenges – different approaches and algorithms in a common Software Environment
(provided by the collaborative platform) facilitates the comparison and the evaluation between different methodologies, which is one of the main
requirements requested by scientific experts who develop algorithms in the EO field. 

The E-CEO Data Challenges platform provides a collaborative research environment for:

* Automation of data mining and information extraction experiments
* Generation of reproducible results that can be easily shared
* Addressing specific scientific challenges and tackling new research problems in a “parallel and collaborative way”

Challenges Phases
-----------------
A challenge (which is the core part of the portal) is divided into 6 phases:

|contestcreated.png| Challenge is under creation 
|contestpromoted.png| Challenge is visible
|contestopen.png| Challenge is open to applications 
|contestinprogress.png| Challenge is In Progress 
|contestonevaluation.png| Challenge is On Evaluation 
|contestclosed.png| Challenge is Closed 


1. **Challenge created** |contestcreated.png|
	-  Challenge creation and definition
	-  Challenge modification
	-  Challenge promotion
	-  Challenge users management
	-  Series and data package management
	-  Data package for challenge management
	-  Challenge Environment management
	-  Evaluation Criterion creation
	-  Evaluation Tree management
	-  Notifications cleaning

2. **Challenge visible** |contestpromoted.png|
	-  Challenge description can be accessed

3. **Challenge promoted** |contestopen.png|
	-  Application to a challenge
	-  User certificate upload
	-  Challenge start
	-  Challenge users management
	-  Environment creation
	-  Notifications cleaning

4. **Challenge started** |contestinprogress.png|
	-  Participant Application status update (packaging)
	-  Participant Application status update (validation)
	-  Participant Application references update
	-  Challenge stop
	-  Notifications cleaning

5. **Challenge ended / on evaluation** |contestonevaluation.png|
	-  Participant Application status update (evaluation)
	-  Participant Application references update
	-  Environment nodes scalability
	-  Notifications cleaning

6. **Challenge closed** |contestclosed.png|
	-  Challenge results are published and accessible.


Challenges User Roles
---------------------

The software can be use by 4 type of users: 

* Participants
* Initiators
* Evaluators
* Administrators.

Challenge **participants** will use the platform to:

-  get information about a challenge,
-  get information about their Private Environment,
-  get support from the support team,
-  provide information about their application,
-  get application evaluation result

Challenge **initiators** will use the platform to:

-  define a challenge,
-  get challenge status and evolution,
-  accept or reject users for a challenge,
-  define data packages

Challenge **evaluators** will use the platform to:

-  define challenge evaluation tree,
-  evaluate participant application,
-  get information about the Evaluation Environment

Challenge **administrators** will use the platform to:

-  accept or reject users for a challenge,
-  set-up environments,
-  validate participant applications,
-  define data packages
