The catalogue follows the schema adopted by the Terradue   Access   (CAS) and other metadata catalogues in which entries are catagorised as series and datasets and organised using virtual URLs that make their relationship clear. 
A typical CAS provides RESTful interfaces for adding, altering or deleting series and data sets where the URLs are organised as <base-url>[/<series-name>[/<dataset-name>]]/<format>. The   class follows this model. 
Note that there is ongoing confusion between the terms series (or dataset) on one side and data set (or product) on the other side.
