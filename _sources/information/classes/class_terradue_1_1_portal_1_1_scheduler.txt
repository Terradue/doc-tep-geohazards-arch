A task scheduler creates tasks according to variable and fixed parameters and the scheduling mode.
There are two scheduling modes: 
In order to work automatically, the background agent must be running and the   action must be enabled.
Alternatively, for debug purposes, the scheduler can be advanced manually and the resulting tasks can be submitted manually.
