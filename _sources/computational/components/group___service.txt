This component is a wrapper for all users’ application level functionalities. It implements an open framework to plug services that then creates :ref:`Task <group___task>` or :ref:`Scheduler <group___scheduler>`. This framework controls common service functionalities:

- :ref:`Persistence of Data <group___persistence>` on the service
- Service definition parsing and template build
- :ref:`Task <group___task>` creation Practically, every service implements IService that defines all the parameters the service must or may include in the task or scheduler and several functions that
- prepares the data access request view template for the web client;
- reviews the parameters’ correctness;
- builds the task with parameterized jobs composition. Once the task created by the service, the assigned :ref:`Computing Resource <group___computing_resource>` handles it for submission.

Dependencies
------------
- :ref:`Persistence of Data <group___persistence>` stores the service reference in the database

- :ref:`Authorisation <group___authorisation>` controls access on the services

- creates new :ref:`Task <group___task>`

- is available on :ref:`Computing Resource <group___computing_resource>`
