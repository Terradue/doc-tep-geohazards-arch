Computational Viewpoint - Level of abstraction
##############################################

This section describes the design choices to cope with the usage constraints. I describes the computational model that manly consists of :
 
- the components (objects) participating to the real‚Äêtime behaviour, from which the system is constructed;
- the service model on which the system is executed and its associated mechanisms;
- the means of communication between components/objects (e.g. interfaces, format, parameters)
