Enterprise Viewpoint - Requirements - CEOS Pilot on Seismic Hazards
####################################################################

The CEOS Pilot on Seismic Hazards is driven by the CEOS Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Observation Strategy, 
and is delivered by CEOS as a response to a collection of observation requirements from the user community, 
to be implemented in 2014-2016.

The CEOS Pilot on Seismic Hazards aims at demonstrating: 
a) added-value and uniqueness of increased CEOS coordination in this area; 
b) benefits of closer ties to users and ease of access to data; 
c) potential for increased roles of space agencies in Disasters Risk Management, for the 10-year period starting in 2015.

In support of this vision, the ESA Geohazards Exploitatin Platform, 
as a Cloud Platform contributing to community building in this Pilot area,
is aiming at supporting the Seismic Hazards community with the realization of three pragmatic objectives:

EV_Obj seismic1: Support production of new observations of the seismic belts (around 15% of the land surface)
EV_Obj seismic2: Contribute to improved understanding of seismic events
EV_Obj volcano3: Support Geoscience users to characterize, understand, and model seismic risk

These objectives are contributing the present architecture Enterprise Viewpoint, 
and they are specified as part of the community contract aimed at supporting the CEOS PIlot.
They relate to several Processes of the ESA Geohazards Exploitatin Platform, modeled in this architecture document (EV_Process),
and enabled as interactions on the Platform in which Enterprise objects participate (Cloud resources, Processing services, Web Portal, ...).

The corresponding system requirements for the implementation of the 3 identified objectives are as follows:
