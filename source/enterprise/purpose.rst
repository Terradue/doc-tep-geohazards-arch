Enterprise Viewpoint - Purpose of the system
############################################

We present here the Enterprise Viewpoint describing the Geohazards Thematic Exploitation Platform (TEP). 
This viewpoint defines the purpose, scope and policies governing the activities supported by the Platform accross the GEO and CEOS initiatives.
It provides the basis for checking the conformance of the Platform implementation.

According to RM-ODP, the Geohazards TEP's Enterprise Viewpoint specification is structured in terms of communities and community objects.
The community is modeled with the following concepts and their relationships:

**Objectives of the community**

An objective is specified in a community contract (e.g. a charter, a directive, ...) in terms of a foreseen community achievement that the Platform will support by enabling a collective behaviour.

* EV_Objective (gsnl1): support collaboration of space and in-situ data providers
* EV_Objective (gnsl2):
* EV_Objective ():
* EV_Objective ():
* EV_Objective (seismic1):
* EV_Objective (seismic2):
* EV_Objective ():
* EV_Objective ():
* EV_Objective (volcano1):
* EV_Objective (volcano2):
* EV_Objective ():
* EV_Objective ():

**Roles and Processes of the community behaviours**

The roles model, for example, the users, the owners and the providers of data or informations processed by the system.
The processes model, for example, the sequence of actions carried out to fulfill an objective.

* EV_Role:
* EV_Behaviour:
* EV_Process:

**Policies**

* EV_Policy_Envelop:
* EV_Policy_Value:
