Enterprise Viewpoint - Purpose of the system
############################################

The Enterprise Viewpoint describes the G-TEP science and business requirements and how to meet them.

Community contract
------------------

The objective of the community is expressed in a contract that specifies how the objective can be met. This contract:
– states the objective for which the community exists;
– governs the structure, the behaviour and the policies of the community;
– constrains the behaviour of the members of the community;
– states the rules for the assignment of enterprise objects to roles.

The satellite EO and geohazards community is growing in size and importance, with the advent of large new initiatives and projects of global interest. 
The geohazard platform or GEP offers this expanding community a unique set of tools to forge new applications in direct collaboration with large numbers of actors. 
In particular, the community will benefit from a cloud-based workspace, allowing advanced EO data exploitation activities and offering access to a broad range of shared processing tools. 
Each partner brings their tools and processing chains, but also has access in the same workspace to large data sets and shared processing tools. 
The vision for the Platform was inspired by the Scientific & Technical Memorandum of the the International Forum on Satellite EO for Geohazards [R1]_.

Beyond operational users with a mandate in seismic risk management, there is a range of geoscience users in research institutes and universities and focused on the scientific use of data with the main goal of understanding the physics of earthquakes thereby improving our ability to characterize, understand, and model seismic risk.

The Satellite EO for Geohazards community includes a range of different actors, including:

* Satellite data providers

  * Satellite data providers are typically national or international space agencies like ESA, which operate satellites. 
  * They may also be commercial satellite operators or commercial suppliers of data.

* Value-adder companies (or VACs)

  * Value-adder companies using satellite data to generate information products that can be used directly by end users to address a need. 
  * Value-adder companies active in a wide range of information sectors ranging from oil and gas industries to environmental applications, disaster risk management and many others.

* Research institute and academia

  * Either involved under government-sponsored grants for basic research 
  * Or in support of applied research objectives

* Industrial partners with an interest in geohazards research.

* Operational geohazards actors including

  * National and regional civil protection agencies
  * Seismological centres and national and local authorities in charge of seismic risk management activities 

* Actors also include other forms of association of researchers

  * Community of researchers active in the Geohazard Supersites and Natural Laboratories (GSNL)
  * the European Plate Observing System (EPOS)

The CEOS Working Group on Disasters is committed to support and enhance the access to in-situ and satellite observations ...
