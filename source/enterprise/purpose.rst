Enterprise Viewpoint - Purpose of the system
############################################

We present here the Enterprise Viewpoint describing the Geohazards Thematic Exploitation Platform (TEP). 
This viewpoint defines the purpose, scope and policies governing the activities supported by the Platform accross the GEO and CEOS initiatives.
It provides the basis for checking the conformance of the Platform implementation.

Standards and services supporting the user requirements and the data access and sharing policies expressed in this RM-ODP Enterprise Model and in the RM-ODP Information Model are identified in the RM-ODP Computational Model.
Software packaging and deployment constraints are compiled in the RM-ODP Technology Viewpoint and the RM-ODP Engineering Viewpoint.

Definitions
-----------

According to RM-ODP, the Geohazards TEP's Enterprise Viewpoint specification is structured in terms of communities and community objects.
The community is modeled with the following concepts and their relationships:

**Objectives of the community**
An objective is specified in a community contract (e.g. a charter, a directive, ...) in terms of a foreseen community achievement that the Platform will support by enabling a collective behaviour.

**Roles and Processes of the community behaviours**
The roles model the users, the owners and the providers of data or informations processed by the system.
The processes model the sequence of actions carried out to fulfill an objective.

**Policies**
The policies model a set of rules related to a particular purpose, that specify a behaviour, or constraints on behaviour, of the Platform.
They implement a particular business or operational decision. 
A policy enveloppe concept encompasses the successive policy values applied during the lifecycle of the system.

Community contract
------------------

The satellite EO and geohazards community is growing in size and importance, with the advent of large new initiatives and projects of global interest. 
The geohazard platform or GEP offers this expanding community a unique set of tools to forge new applications in direct collaboration with large numbers of actors. 
In particular, the community will benefit from a cloud-based workspace, allowing advanced EO data exploitation activities and offering access to a broad range of shared processing tools. 
Each partner brings their tools and processing chains, but also has access in the same workspace to large data sets and shared processing tools. 
The vision for the Platform was inspired by the Scientific & Technical Memorandum of the the International Forum on Satellite EO for Geohazards [R1]_.

Beyond operational users with a mandate in seismic risk management, there is a range of geoscience users in research institutes and universities and focused on the scientific use of data with the main goal of understanding the physics of earthquakes thereby improving our ability to characterize, understand, and model seismic risk.

The Satellite EO for Geohazards community includes a range of different actors, including:

* Satellite data providers

  * Satellite data providers are typically national or international space agencies like ESA, which operate satellites. 
  * They may also be commercial satellite operators or commercial suppliers of data.

* Value-adder companies (or VACs)

  * Value-adder companies using satellite data to generate information products that can be used directly by end users to address a need. 
  * Value-adder companies active in a wide range of information sectors ranging from oil and gas industries to environmental applications, disaster risk management and many others.

* Research institute and academia

  * Either involved under government-sponsored grants for basic research 
  * Or in support of applied research objectives

* Industrial partners with an interest in geohazards research.

* Operational geohazards actors including

  * National and regional civil protection agencies
  * Seismological centres and national and local authorities in charge of seismic risk management activities 

* Actors also include other forms of association of researchers

  * Community of researchers active in the Geohazard Supersites and Natural Laboratories (GSNL)
  * the European Plate Observing System (EPOS)

The CEOS Working Group on Disasters is committed to support and enhance the access to in-situ and satellite observations ...

System Capabilities
-------------------

The platform is meant to allow users to easily exploit EO data resources by combining fast data access, processing facilities and flexibility for the user's own data analysis. 
The platform provides Data Access, Data Processing Services and PaaS (Platform as a Service). 
Data Access includes the possibility to perform catalogue queries. 
Data Processing Services enable users to process data available in the repository using a number of well know tools and to exploit the results. 
The PaaS enables users to perform their data exploitation activities with large flexibility and autonomy by using one or several virtual hosts directly provided on the Cloud platform where the data sits. 
Users can, therefore, use their virtual hosts to efficiently access data and processing services and immediately elaborate results using analysis and visualization tools available from the PaaS or directly installed in virtual hosts by themselves. 
In addition users can also open their own accounts on a commercial Cloud Provider and directly provision their virtual hosts independently (through the Geohazards Platform Services).
