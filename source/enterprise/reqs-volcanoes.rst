Enterprise Viewpoint - Requirements - CEOS Pilot on Volcanoes
#############################################################

This pilot represents a stepping-stone towards the long-term goals of the Santorini Report on satellite EO and geohazards with respect to volcanic activity, namely: 

1. global background observations at all Holocene volcanoes; 
2. weekly observations at restless volcanoes; 
3. daily observations at erupting volcanoes; 
4. development of novel measurements; 
5. 20-year sustainability; 
and 6. capacity-building. 

Specifically, the pilot aims to:

* Demonstrate the **feasibility** of integrated, systematic and sustained monitoring of Holocene volcanoes using space-based EO;
* Demonstrate **applicability and superior timeliness** of space-based EO products to the operational community (such as volcano observatories and VAACs) for better understanding volcanic activity and reducing impact and risk from eruptions;
* Build the **capacity for use of EO data** in volcanic observatories in Latin America as a showcase for global capacity development opportunities.
