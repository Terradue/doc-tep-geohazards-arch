Computational Viewpoint - Level of abstraction
##############################################

The computational viewpoint is defined within RM-ODP as the recipient for the functional decomposition of the system into a set of objects that interact at interfaces â€“ enabling system distribution. It thus provides the basis for decisions on how to distribute the functions to be handled by the system. 

The Computational specification is used as the baseline for the Engineering specification, the later defining the communications mechanisms supporting the behaviour at the interfaces of the system.
